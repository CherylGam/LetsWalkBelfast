  <h1>Cavehill</h1>
  <p>This has to be my favourite walk in Belfast. It is easy to get to, so perfect for an after work walk. The views of Belfast on clear day are amazing and you can even see as far as the Mourne Mountains</p>

      <h2>The Route</h2>
      <p>I'll give you two routes here. Both of them will give those legs and lungs a good work out</p>

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-6">
        <h3>A dander</h3>
        <p>This one is the castle trail and takes in the castle garden.</p>
        <p>Park in the carpark. From here, take the path to the left at the sign. Follow this path and once you reach the marker for the castle trail, take this path. Follow this path which will take you to the side of the castle. Once in the grounds of the castle, take the path to the front of the castle. This leads to the main gardens. The gardens are worth exploring just to see the statues of the cats. Once you have finished take the path out of the gardens to the road. This road takes you back to the car park.</p>

        <h3>A Wee bit tough</h3>
        <p>This route is great if you have plenty of time and want a really good walk. However, you can cut it short.</p>
        <p>Start at the car park located just outside the castle. Start at the path beside the sign and basically follow this track.Where the track forks, keep left. The climb is sharp but once it levels off, the views are rewarding. They have conveniently created a seat where you can rest but also admire the views over Belfast.</p>

 </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class"col-10">
<p>Once rested continue on an then veer left. In front of you, you can take a short climb up to explore the cave. Otherwise, follow the path round which is known locally as the Devil's punch bowl. The route is simple. You just follow it. Keep to this path, and keep ascending. Dont worry this ascent is much more gentle on your legs than the first one.</p>
<p>When the path starts to level up, to the left is the steps up to the top of Cavehill, known as MacArts fort. You won't be able to miss the crowds who settle here for a while to admire the views.</p>
<p>When you have had enough, climb back down the path to rejoin the main path. Continue on this path. You will begin to descent again. Just keep to the path and when the path forks, keep to the right. Eventually you will get to a car park.</p>
<p>Once at the car park, take a right to cross the car park then to your right in the corner there will be a style. Cross this which will take you to an open area where once there was an old fort. There is a faint track which you follow to the end of the open area. In front of you is the forest.Head to the forest and follow the track through the forest.</p>
<p>Continue the path through the forest and then to your right you will see a fence. Pick up the path towards the fence. Be warned it gets very mucky here. Cross over the fence at the gate and then continue along the track. Eventually you will get back to McArts Fort. Take a left at the main path and follow this back down again to the car park.</p>
