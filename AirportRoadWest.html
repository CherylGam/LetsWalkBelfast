    <h1>Airport Road West</h1>
    <p> This walk seems to be popular with the people who work in this area. It is probably to do with the inaccessibility in getting there. Bus services are limited so you really need a car.</p>
    <p>It is an easy walk that affords views across the lough to Carrickfergus. If you want to watch the cruise ships roll in then this is the perfect spot.</p>
    <p>I have defined a dander or a wee bit hard here, as quite frankly this is a very easy walk.</p>
    <h2>The route</h2>
    <p>If you are travelling by car, take the exit for Holywood Exchange. Then take a right at the main roundabout beside Sainsburys. This takes you into the harbour estate and onto Airport Road West. Continue on this road, and hopefully the sea will be to your right. On your right, once you go round the corner there will be something that resembles a car park. Park here. </p>
    <p>Keep the sea in front of you and then turn right. Follow to the end of the car park, where you will pick up a foot path. Just follow this along the sea. Before you reach the end of the path, take the track to the left.This takes you onto the beach. The beach here is quite and you can spend ages here watching the ships come and go. You are also beside the City Airport, so this makes for a pleasant bit of plane spotting (all being that the wind direction is on your side!)</p>
    <p>Once you've finished admiring the view, take the same path back</p>

    <h2>Facilities</h2>
    <p>Facilities are lacking here but if you need the loo there are toilets in either the B&Q or Sainsburys nearby. They also have a cafe should you need a well earned cup of tea.</p>
